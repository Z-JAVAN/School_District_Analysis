# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview:</br>
School district performance analysis was performed using the Jupyter notebook with Python, the Panda Library, and the Numpy Library. We first provide a preliminary analysis based on data collected from many students and schools across the school district.
  There appear to be some anomalies in the data, especially in the math and reading grades of ninth-grade high school students.
We want to look at the effect of changing all grades 9 in math and reading in Thomas High School - we will now look at how this change has affected various parts of the analysis over time, including Thomas 9 high school grades.
  The consequences of deleting potentially inaccurate data are also discussed.
