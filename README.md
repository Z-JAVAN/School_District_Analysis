# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview:</br>
School district performance analysis was performed using the Jupyter notebook with Python, the Panda Library, and the Numpy Library. We first provide a preliminary analysis based on data collected from many students and schools across the school district.
  There appear to be some anomalies in the data, especially in the math and reading grades of ninth-grade high school students.
We want to look at the effect of changing all grades 9 in math and reading in Thomas High School - we will now look at how this change has affected various parts of the analysis over time, including Thomas 9 high school grades.
  The consequences of deleting potentially inaccurate data are also discussed.
  
### Resources:<br>
<br>Data Source: schools_complete.csv<br>
Data Source: students_complete.csv<br>
Sofware: Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0<br>
Library: Pandas<br>
Library: Numpy<br>
Language: Python 3.6.7<br>
#####Process:
Open Jupyter Notebook files from local directories using a development environment.
Read an external CSV file into a DataFrame.
Format a DataFrame column.
Determine data types of row values in a DataFrame.
Retrieve data from specific columns of a DataFrame.
Merge, filter, slice, and sort a DataFrame.
Apply the groupby() function to a DataFrame.
Use multiple methods to perform a function on a DataFrame.
Perform mathematical calculations on columns of a DataFrame or Series.<br>

#### Results :<br>

We analyzed all the details of the ninth grade Thomas High School students, this analysis was done twice. The first trial of this analysis consisted of a complete set of student data. In the second experiment of this analysis, the ninth grade students of Thomas High School had their scores removed from the calculations and the total grades of the ninth grade of Thomas High School were replaced with NaN.
